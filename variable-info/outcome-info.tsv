A serving of vegetables would be the typical amount dished up as an accompaniment to main meal. e.g. if you had a roast dinner with meat, potatoes, carrots and peas, most people would have one serving of potatoes, one serving of carrots and one serving of peas. For small amounts of vegetables that are not big enough to be counted individually (e.g. in a stew), please guess the number of servings and record that under Vegetable pieces. A serving is about the amount that would be dished up using a serving spoon (large spoon typically used in canteens or self-service buffets). Example: a beef stew with carrot and parsnip may have enough vegetables in it to count as a half serving of carrots plus a half serving of parsnip (possibly even a whole serving if there are a lot of vegetables in the stew). If not, it may be better to record the vegetables as a half serving of Vegetable pieces. For a selection of vegetables where the precise type may be unknown (for example in a shop bought vegetable pie or a stir fry cooked by a friend) please guess the total amount and record that under Vegetable pieces.
